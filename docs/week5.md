✔️ The goal of this week is to learn matrix notation for OLS regression and get familiar with Gauss-Markov theorem. 

## Here are some key points:

## Some suggestions:
- Here is an [exploratory regression shiny application](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ERSA/vignettes/ERSA.html)
- More sources on $y$, $\hat{y}$, and residuals: [source 1](https://condor.depaul.edu/sjost/it223/documents/regress.htm), [source 2](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/04/y-is-for-ys-y-hats-and-residuals/), [source 3](https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/soc_meth_proj3/matrix_OLS_NYU_notes.pdf), [source 4](http://www.unm.edu/~jikaczmarski/working_papers/gm_proof.pdf)
