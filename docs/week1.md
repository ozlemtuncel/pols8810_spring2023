**CAUTION**: DO NOT SOLELY RELY ON MY NOTES. THERE MIGHT BE TYPOS AND MISTAKES. ALWAYS KEEP YOUR OWN NOTES!

The goal of this week is to familiarize yourselves with few basic concepts in math that will help us in OLS. These concepts are:
- **matrix/linear algebra**
- **statistic** vs **parameter**
- **vector** and **scalar** 

## Here are some key points:
- matrix algebra or linear algebra - this is like learning a new language 
- bold face, not italicized - that just means it is matrix 
- a **scalar** is a single number or constant
- a **vector** is a matrix but it is just one row and one column
- a **matrix** has more than one column or row (of vectors)
- a **parameter** - we cannot directly observe it. It helps us to represent entire population / true unknown/value in the population, it is theroretically possible to know but practically impossible. We use greek letters.  
- a **statistic** - give me your best guess about some data (e.g., mean of a sample)
- We cannot never get the parameter, we can only estimate it using statistics. 
- special matrices (e.g., square matrix, symmetric matrix) are important in some instances because you have to have certain types of matrices to perform certain operations
- an **inverse of matrix** is a matrix whether in which we pre-multiply or post-multiply the matrix with it and it yields an identity matrix

## Some recommendations: 
- Definitely go over your notes and practice some matrix operations 
- Think about why we are talking about matrices before focusing on OLS theory
- Get familiarize with concepts like parameter, scalar, vector, etc.
