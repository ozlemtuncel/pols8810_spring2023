✔️ The goal of this week is to familiarize yourselves with basic probability theory. These concepts are:
- **Probability**, **joint probability**

## Here are some key points:
- **Probability** is indicated either as 0 (zero, never happens) or 1 (one, always happens). 
- Percentages and probabilities are almost the same. 
- **Joint probability** is the probability of two or more things occuring together 
- **Statistical independence** indicates that the condition has no impact on the probability
- **Independence** occurs when one of event has no effect on the other event. Statistical independence and **mutual exclusivity** are two important concepts we are learning today. 
- **p-value**: is the probability that we would get our sample value given that the null hypothesis is true. 

## Some recommendations: 
-  Get familiarize with probability theory, set notation,
