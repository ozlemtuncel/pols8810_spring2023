# Schedule

## Week 1

> ✔️ Main Goal: Get familiar with LaTeX to typeset your problem sets.

**Learning LaTeX**
I encourage all of you to get familiar with **LaTeX** or any kind of document preparation system to typset your problem sets. GSU offers online/in-person LaTeX course. I personally use Overleaf for typetting these sort of documents. Recently, I have been using Quarto in R and Phyton to typeset reports and presentations. Here are some useful links to learn LaTeX:

- GSU Library's [LaTeX workshop](https://research.library.gsu.edu/latex)
- Overleaf's [30-minute guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
- Overleaf's detailed [3-part guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1))

You can alternatively learn and use **R Markdown** or **Quarto**. Here are some useful links:

- [Using Quarto in R](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- Posit's (previously known as R Studio) guide to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

## Week 2

> ✔️ Main Goal: Get familiar with tidyverse and base R in R Studio. 

In POLS 8805, you used R and R Studio, but mainly relied on tidyverse in data manipulation and management. We are also going to incorporate and learn base R which is going to be highly useful.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```


```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
