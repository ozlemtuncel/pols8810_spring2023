# Ozlem's Office Hours and TA Sessions
- My office: Langdale Hall Room 1027
- Office hours: Monday 1-3 pm and Thursday 9-11 am.
- In addition to office hours, I will be conducting lab sessions for three purposes: to answer your software related questions, supplementing class material, questions about problem sets, and help with general methodology matters. If you have any particular subject that you want to discuss in these workshops, please let me know!

# Slides, Notes, and Tips

## Week 1

### Class materials 
> ‚úîÔ∏è Goal: Get familiar with matrix algebra and perform basic matrix algebra operations.

[Week 1 Slides](docs/01Matrix.pdf)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 1 class](docs/week1.md)

### Software and others
> ‚úîÔ∏è Goal 1: Participate in Josh's R sessions to learn more about base R.

> ‚úîÔ∏è Goal 2: Get familiar with LaTeX to typeset your problem sets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Josh's workshops are not mandatory, but I highly recommend them! 

**Learning LaTeX**
I encourage all of you to get familiar with **LaTeX** or similar kind of document preparation system to typset your problem sets. GSU offers online/in-person LaTeX course. I use Overleaf for typetting these sort of documents. Recently, I have been using Quarto in R and Phyton to typeset reports and presentations. Here are some useful links to learn LaTeX:

- GSU Library's [LaTeX workshop](https://research.library.gsu.edu/latex)
- Visit Dr. Fix's [website](http://michaelfix.gsucreate.org/) for his LaTeX presentations.
- Overleaf's [30-minute guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
- Overleaf's detailed [3-part guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1))

You can alternatively learn and use **R Markdown** or **Quarto**. Here are some useful links:

- [Using Quarto in R](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
- Posit's (previously known as R Studio) guide to [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

## Week 2

### Class materials 
> ‚úîÔ∏è Goal: Get familiar with the basics of probability and distribution.

[Week 2 Slides](docs/02Probability.pdf)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 2 class](docs/week2.md)

### Software and others 
> No update here! I highly recommend Josh's R workshops. 

## Week 3

> ‚úîÔ∏è Goal: Get familiar with the basics of descriptive stats and representing your data visually.

[Week 3 Slides](docs/03Data.pdf)

[Ozlem's notes from Week 3 class](docs/week3.md)

**Suggestions for descriptive stats (and other things)**
For basic descriptive stats and understanding your data, base R is more than enough! So, do not bother with tidy language (which can be overkill sometimes). Here are some further suggestions and examples: 

- [Great summary of basic descriptive stats in R](https://statsandr.com/blog/descriptive-statistics-in-r/)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Intro from Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) - I recommend this book for learning R. [Hadley](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) is the one who created the whole tidyverse universe, so he knows what he is doing. üëç
- [Another EDA vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlookr/vignettes/EDA.html) - This is going to be extremely useful with Gauss-Markov assumptions. 
- [Want to learn more about R and how it works under the hood (all base R)? Read this!](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) - This is my go-to book to R (again Hadley wrote this). ‚≠ê
- [All the possible things you can do with ggplot2](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) - Of course, this is not the complete list. There is always going to be one specific thing that needs additional package (e.g., I was trying to do cluster dendongrams which does not exist in ggplot2 but exists as [ggdendro](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdendro/vignettes/ggdendro.html). So, google it if you are not sure!). 
- [For those who want to learn GitHub - here is how I learned](https://happygitwithr.com/) - Git might be a bit of advance at this point, but it is essential part of every project that I do. So, version control everything (future you will be super happy) and I like how GitHub can be easy. Feel free to ask if you have any questions about version control and Git!
- - For graphing in ggplot and design decisions Josh highly recommends [Cederic Scherer's Graphic Design with ggplot2](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/), [Cederic Scherer's talks more generally](https://www.cedricscherer.com/top/portfolio/), and [Andrew Heiss's Data Visualization class](https://datavizs21.classes.andrewheiss.com/)
- To make good tables in R with minimal effort Josh recommends [modelsummary](https://datavizs21.classes.andrewheiss.com/)
